    <p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a href="">J. M. Barrie</a>. A
        free-spirited
        and mischievous young boy
        who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of
        <a href="">Neverland</a> as the
        leader of the <a href="">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with <a href="">fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans</a>, and occasionally
        ordinary children from the
        world outside Neverland.</p>
    <p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works by
        Barrie,
        <i><a href="">The Little White Bird</a></i> (1902, with chapters 13â€“18 published in <i><a href="">Peter Pan in Kensington
            Gardens</a></i> in 1906), and the<a href="">West End stage</a> play <i><a href="">Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow
            Up</a></i>
        (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel<i><a href="">Peter and Wendy</a>)</i>,
        the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include
        several films,
        television series and many other works.</p>
    <p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in
        <a href="">Kensington Gardens</a> on 30 April
        1912 as a surprise to the children of London.<a href=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and
        displayed around the
        world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a href="">series of UK postage stamps</a> issued by the <a href="">Royal Mail</a> on the
        centenary of Barrie's creation of
        the character<a href=""><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
