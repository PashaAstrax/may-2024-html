    <h2>BMW history</h2><br>
    <p>BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines. However, after the First World War,
        the
        company was forced to change direction due to a ban on the production of aircraft. In 1923, BMW released its first motorcycle,
        the
        BMW R32, and in 1928 entered the automobile business by acquiring the Eisenach plant and starting car production.</p>

    <p>A significant milestone in the history of BMW was the release in 1933 of the BMW 303, the company's first car with the
        characteristic radiator grille, which became a signature feature of all future models. In the post-war years, the company quickly
        re-established production of cars and motorcycles, producing iconic models such as the BMW 507 and BMW 700.</p>

    <p>In the 1960s, BMW introduced the "Neue Klasse" series, which became the basis of the brand's success in the global market. Since
        then, the company has continued to amaze the world with innovation and design. Significant achievements include the launch of the
        BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, as well as the introduction of turbocharging technology and the development of EfficientDynamics, aimed at
        reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.</p>

    <p>Today, BMW continues to lead the premium segment, offering vehicles that combine luxury, sportiness and advanced technology. The
        company is actively investing in electric vehicles and autonomous technologies, striving to remain at the forefront of the
        automotive industry.</p>
